# Nonlinear Iterative Closest Point
A quick project I took on this weekend cause I was bored. I was asked this week if I had developed my own non-linear iterative closest point library for my 
thesis work and I wondered why I didn't. So then I did. This was a few hours worth of work and it still requires a lot of work to make it usable but
I figured I'd post it for now. 

I'll put up a demo/instructions soon.

The point cloud found in the data directory is from PCL's region growing tutorial.
